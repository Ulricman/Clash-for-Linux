# Clash-for-Linux

Downloaded from [Clash Releases](https://www.clash.la/releases/). For me, I downloaded **GUI.for.Clash-linux-amd64** and kernel **clash-linux-amd64**, and place executable file **mihomo-linux-amd64** into folder **GUI.for.Clash-linux-amd64/data** . After starting it and entering your config URL, you can use it.
